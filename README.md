## Hi there, I'm Cris 👋

After completing my degree in Ancient History, I made a deliberate shift in my professional journey by enrolling in a Data Analytics bootcamp. Both History and Data Science share a profound emphasis on the significance of data to draw conclusions, so I've long recognized the significance of data in drawing insights and making informed decisions, and I'm enthusiastic about the prospect of being part of an industry that seamlessly blends technology and creativity. I also fell in love with programming, as it is challenging as it is rewarding. 

#### Skills 👩🏻‍💻:

I have learned Python, SQL (MySQL) for database management. I also have experience with Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy for numerical computation in Python, and Seaborn/Matplotlib for data visualization. I'm also familiar with Scikit-Learn for machine learning methods. Finally, I've worked with both Tableau & Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
